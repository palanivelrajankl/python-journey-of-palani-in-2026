# Python-Journey-of-Palani-in-2026
HEyy I am Palanivelrajan and here i am just posting my code and also the Growth of Mine...That's Actually "A collection of my daily scripts and experiments as I learn Python."
## 🎓 Day 4 : The "Mam/Sir" Interaction Experiment
**Project Name:** `Exam_Teacher_Game.py`

### 📖 The Story
I wanted to build something where the user isn't just a "user"—they are a **character**. In this script, the person running the code becomes my Teacher. 

### 🛠️ Logic & Lessons
- **User Input (`input()`):** I learned how to pause the universe and wait for a human to speak.
- **The String vs. Integer War:** I mastered the difference between text data and number data.
- **Story-Based Coding:** I realized that `if/else` isn't just for math; it's for creating different endings to a story.
