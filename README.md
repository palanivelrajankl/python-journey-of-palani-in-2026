# Python-Journey-of-Palani-in-2026
HEyy I am Palanivelrajan and here i am just posting my code and also the Growth of Mine...That's Actually "A collection of my daily scripts and experiments as I learn Python."
## 📍 Day 1: The "HEyy" Declaration 🛡️
**The Script:** `HEyy.py`
- **The Story:** This was the day I fought a literal AI for my identity. It wanted "lowercase professionalism," but I wanted **HEyy**. I chose my heart over the machine's rules.
- **The Magic:** Mastered the `print()` function and realized that a 6-letter filename can tell a whole story.
- **Status:** **IDENTITY SECURED** ✅
- ## 📍 Day 2: The Student Survival Simulator 📉
**The Script:** `Palani_Mark_Math.py`
- **The Story:** I simulated the life of a student. I watched my marks rise with "Bit" (cheating) and "Friends," only to see them crushed by the "Teacher" and "HOD" variables. 
- **The Magic:** 
  - **Variable Transformation:** `Palani_Mark += Bit`
  - **Floor Division (`//`):** Because HODs always round your happiness down to the nearest integer! 
- **Status:** **LOGIC MASTERED** 🧠
## 🎓 Day 3 : The "Mam/Sir" Interaction Experiment
**Project Name:** `Exam_Teacher_Game.py`

### 📖 The Story
I wanted to build something where the user isn't just a "user"—they are a **character**. In this script, the person running the code becomes my Teacher. 

### 🛠️ Logic & Lessons
- **User Input (`input()`):** I learned how to pause the universe and wait for a human to speak.
- **The String vs. Integer War:** I mastered the difference between text data and number data.
- **Story-Based Coding:** I realized that `if/else` isn't just for math; it's for creating different endings to a story.
